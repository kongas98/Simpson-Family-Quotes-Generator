# Simpson Family Quotes Generator

This Python script generates random quotes from the members of the Simpson family, including Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.

## About

This project was an exercise that I found quite challenging, particularly due to the complex dictionaries used to organize the family members' information. Despite the complexity, I'm excited to share it with others and hope you enjoy the random quotes from the Simpsons family!
